# Overview

**Game type**: race game

**Number of players**: 2-4

**Age of players**: 6-106

**Duration:** 30 minutes – 1.5 hours

# What you need to play

 Single standard **dice**

A **set of 4 pegs for each player**. Each set needs to be in a different color.

A **board** which meets these criteria:

- There is a single track with fields for all pegs to race in.

- Each corner of the board is the *Out* corner for each player.

- Each player has their own *Start* field next to their _Out_ corner.

- Each player has their *Home* row in the center of the board.


# Goal

Each player’s goal is to get all their pegs from their *Out* corner to their *Home* row. Players advance their pegs by the number of dots thrown on the dice. The player who gets all their pegs *Home* first, wins.

# How to play

1. Place all your pegs in your *Out* corner.

2. To bring a peg to the game (move it from your *Out* corner to your *Start* field) you must throw six on the dice.

3. Once the peg is racing, you can advance it by the number of dots thrown on the dice. If you have several pegs on the track, it is up to you to decide which peg to advance.

4. To bring a peg *Home*, you must throw exactly the number of dots that the pegs needs to occupy a field in the *Home* row.  
  
**Example**  
If your peg is two fields away from the *Home* row, and you throw three on the dice, your peg can only take the first field of your *Home* row.  
If you throw six, your peg can take only the last field in the *Home* row.

# Rules

## Moving the pegs

All players move their pegs in a clockwise direction.

You can jump over other players’ pegs.

You can throw out other players’ pegs into that players’ *Out* corners if your peg lands on them.  
See Throwing out pegs below for details.

If you have several pegs on the track, you decide which peg to move after throwing the dice.

You cannot bring a peg to the game if your *Start* field is still taken by your other peg.

  
## Throwing the dice

If you throw six on the dice, you are entitled to another throw.  

**Example**
If your throw six and then five, you can move your peg by eleven fields. You can move only one peg. You cannot move one peg by six fields and another by five.  

If you throw six and then six again, you are entitled to one last throw.

If not all your pegs are yet out racing, you must bring in the peg to the game if you throw six on the dice.

## Throwing out pegs

You cannot throw out your own pegs (you can have two or more of your pegs in the same field).

If your *Start* field is taken by a peg of another player, you may throw that peg out to that player’s *Out* corner.

You can be thrown out from your *Start* field to your *Out* corner by another player.

# Assumptions 

The Product team will come up with the game name.

The UX team will provide styling and images that are consistent with the brand book. I am only required to define the structure of the document.

There will be a styleguide that defines the tone and language choices (for example, writing our numbers or using the digit: *six* vs *6*, or using contractions: *you’re* vs *you are*).

The document is a quick start guide – contains enough information to play the game, but not all the detail.
