Welcome to my Technical Writer's portfolio! Here you can find samples of my work that will help you evaluate my writing skills. 

## Branching strategy
- **main** - This is the branch that contains final work ready for evaluation.
- **dev_filename** - Dev_filename branches contain work in progress. They're equivalent to feature branches in many popular git branching strategies. I create a dev_filename branch for each new document I'm working on. Documentation in this branch is incomplete and may contain errors. However, you can visit this branch to understand how I develop documentation. When the document is ready for evaluation, I create a PR to the **main** branch, and the dev_filename is deleted.
